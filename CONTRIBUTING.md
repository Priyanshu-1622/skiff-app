# Contributing to Skiff

Thanks for your interest in Skiff. It's a self-hosted SSH connection manager, maintained primarily by one person, and contributions are genuinely welcome — bug reports, fixes, features, docs, all of it. This guide explains how to get set up and what to keep in mind so your contribution lands smoothly.

## Before you start

**For anything bigger than a small fix, open an issue first.** It's much easier to agree on an approach before code exists than to rework a finished PR. This is especially true for features — Skiff has a deliberate scope (see the "What Skiff doesn't do" section in the README), and a feature that doesn't fit is a frustrating thing to find out about after you've built it.

Bug reports are always useful. A good one includes what you did, what you expected, what happened, and your environment (OS, Node version, Docker or dev). If it's a security issue, **don't** open a public issue — see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

## Project layout

Skiff is a pnpm monorepo with two apps and one shared package:

```
apps/web        React + Vite frontend
apps/api        Fastify + better-sqlite3 backend
packages/shared TypeScript types shared by both
```

The frontend and backend are decoupled — the web app talks to the API over HTTP and WebSocket, with no direct imports between them. The only thing they share is the types in `packages/shared`.

## Getting set up

You'll need **Node 20+** and **pnpm 9+**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Priyanshu-1622/skiff.git
cd skiff
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` runs the API and the Vite dev server together. Open http://localhost:5173. On first load you'll set up a vault.

**Windows note:** `better-sqlite3` and `argon2` are native modules and compile from source. You need Visual Studio Build Tools with "Desktop development with C++". See the Troubleshooting section in the README if `pnpm install` fails to build them.

### Building

```bash
pnpm build
```

This builds the shared package first, then the API, then the web app, in that order (the order matters — the others depend on `@skiff/shared` being compiled). If you change types in `packages/shared`, rebuild it before the consumers will see the changes.

## Code standards

- **TypeScript strict mode is on.** Please keep it on. If you're fighting the types, that's usually the design telling you something — reach for `unknown` and narrowing before `any`.
- **Format with Prettier** before committing.
- **Match the existing style.** The codebase favors clear, direct code over cleverness, prose comments only where the *why* isn't obvious (not the *what*), and minimal abstraction. New code should look like it belongs.
- **Frontend:** components live in `apps/web/src/routes` and `apps/web/src/components`. Styling is plain CSS with design tokens (`apps/web/src/styles/tokens.css`) — no Tailwind, no CSS-in-JS. Reuse the tokens; don't hardcode colors.
- **Backend:** routes are thin; crypto lives in `apps/api/src/crypto`; shared helpers in `apps/api/src/lib`. Every route that touches credentials goes through the session/vault-key plumbing — don't bypass it.

## Working with security-sensitive code

Skiff's whole job is protecting credentials, so changes to anything under `apps/api/src/crypto`, the auth routes, or the session store get extra scrutiny. If your change touches encryption, key handling, authentication, or the team-mode shared-key logic:

- Explain the security reasoning in the PR description.
- Don't introduce a way for a credential, password, or key to be written to disk unencrypted, logged, or sent to the client.
- The audit log must never contain secrets — only metadata.
- If you're unsure whether something is safe, ask in the issue before building it.

When in doubt, read [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) — it describes the intended model, and contributions shouldn't quietly weaken it.

## Commits and pull requests

- **Commit messages:** be specific enough that `git log --oneline` reads like a changelog. A `type: summary` style (e.g. `fix: terminal resize race`, `feat: team audit log`) is appreciated but not enforced.
- **Keep PRs focused.** One logical change per PR is far easier to review than a grab-bag. If you find yourself writing "and also…" in the description, consider splitting it.
- **Make sure it builds and type-checks** (`pnpm build`) before opening the PR.
- **Reference the issue** your PR addresses.

## A note on scope

Skiff intentionally does a small set of things well rather than everything. Some requests — full RBAC, SFTP, SSO, bastion chains — are explicitly out of scope for the open-source project. That's not a judgment on the idea; it's about keeping the project maintainable by a small team. If you're not sure whether something fits, the issue thread is the place to find out.

## License

Skiff is dual-licensed, and which license applies depends on the files you
touch:

| Path | License |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/core/` | Apache-2.0 |
| everything else | AGPL-3.0-only |

`packages/core` is the engine — SSH sessions, vault, recording, audit, database.
It's permissive so every build of Skiff can import it, including builds that
aren't open source themselves. Everything built on top of it stays AGPL, which
is what prevents Skiff being taken closed-source and run as a commercial
service. See `NOTICE` at the repository root.

### Sign your commits

Every commit needs a `Signed-off-by` line. Add one automatically with `-s`:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Fix reconnect after network change"
```

This is the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/):
you're asserting that you wrote the code, or have the right to submit it, and
that you're contributing it under the license above. There's nothing to sign and
no document to store.

It's enforced by CI because of the dual license — without a record of who
agreed to what, changing a license later means tracking down every past
contributor individually. Signing off keeps that from ever becoming a problem.

If you forget:

```bash
git commit --amend -s          # most recent commit
git rebase --signoff main      # several commits
```
